A static site starter kit built with Eleventy, Tailwind and Alpine.

### Motivation
Not all websites need to be built with React. As crazy as that sounds to so many, it's true. There is still a wide world of simple informational sites out there that need to be simple and fast. There is no better way to achieve that than with core web technology like HTML, but maintaining static HTML files is an old man's game.

[Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) is a static site generator that makes maintaining static HTML files a much more pleasant experience.
